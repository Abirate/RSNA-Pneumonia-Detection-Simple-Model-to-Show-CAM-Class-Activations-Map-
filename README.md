# RSNA-Pneumonia-Detection-Challenge

Pneumonia accounts for over 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from the disease. In the United States, pneumonia accounts for over 500,000 visits to emergency departments [1] and over 50,000 deaths in 2015 [2], keeping the ailment on the list of top 10 causes of death in the country.
