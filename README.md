# Computing and Visualizing Class Activation Maps **CAM** Using the RSNA Pneumonia-Detection Challenge DatasetÂ 

Pneumonia accounts for over 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from the disease. In the United States, pneumonia accounts for over 500,000 visits to emergency departments and over 50,000 deaths in 2015, keeping the ailment on the list of top 10 causes of death in the country.

- I built a classifier to predict whether an X-Ray of a patient shows signs of pneumonia or not based on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge).
- The main purpose of this repo is to show how to **compute** and **visualize** the **CAM Class Activation Maps** .
